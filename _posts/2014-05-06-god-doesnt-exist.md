There's many arguments, theories and explanations about why God doesn't exist and how it's impossible for God to exist, but this argument has got to be my favourite. 

Falling firmly into the paradox category, it attempts to use absolute logic to argue away the existsnce of a theological being. 

Here's my interpretation of it.

### The argument
If God exists, and we presume he is [omniscient][1] as many versions of God are, then we have to presume that free will doesn't exist. 

If God knows everything from now until the end of time, then there is no such thing as free will, because God already knows it will happen.
