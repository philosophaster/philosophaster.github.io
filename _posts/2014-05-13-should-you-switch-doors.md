Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: 

1. Behind one door is a car.
2. Behind the other two doors are goats.

You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

Your first thought is probably to stick with your door, but you'd be wrong. Your chances of winning increase by 1/3 if you switch doors.

Contestants who switch have a 2/3 chance of winning the car, while contestants who stick to their choice have only a 1/3 chance. It's pure probability, but it's hard to grasp at first when you think about it.
