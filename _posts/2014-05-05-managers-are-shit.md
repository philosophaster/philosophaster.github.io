The Peter Principle is the basic flaw of "promoting from within".

It describes the common misconception in business that it's good to keep promoting people that are good at their jobs to a higher position in the company. 

The theory describes the eventual weakness of this idea: being that you'll eventually promote someone into a job they're not good at, ultimately leading us to why most managers are terrible at their jobs.

Basically, if you’re in a big organisation, and they're looking to promote and you’re happy and good at your job, give up while you’re ahead.

Or you’ll end up being hated, and rubbish at your job.
