This is a really interesting one, but probably one of the most challenging to get your head around at first.

Consider the follow sentence.

> Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.

Yes, it's a sentence. Using only the word _buffalo_ it's possible to make a perfectly valid and grammatically correct sentence. Here's it broken down.

The sentence uses 3 different meanings for the word buffalo.

1. The city of Buffalo, New York.
2. The noun buffalo, meaning the animal. As a plural form the word is also just buffalo.
3. The verb buffalo, meaning to bully somebody.

With explanations added in between the words, it looks something like this.

> Buffalo buffalo (buffalo from Buffalo NY) [that] Buffalo buffalo buffalo (that the buffalo from Buffalo NY bully) buffalo Buffalo buffalo (are bullying buffalo from Buffalo NY)

Put a little simpler, it could read this.

> New York bison whom other New York bison bully, themselves bully New York bison.

So there you go. A perfectly valid sentence using only one word. This is why English is so difficult to learn.
