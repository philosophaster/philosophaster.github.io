Here's another probability problem. 

If you have 367 people in 1 room, the probability of 2 people having the same birthday is 100%. 

Sounds believable, right? But this is the weird part: you only need 70 people in a room for the probability of 2 people having the same birthday to be 99.9%. 

Even crazier, if you have 23 people in a room, the probability of 2 people having the same birthday is 50%. 

It turns out that something that sounds so rare isn't actually that rare, if you take probability into account. 

Bonus fact: the maths behind working out the probability of this fact lead to a cryptographic attack dubbed the [birthday attack][1].
