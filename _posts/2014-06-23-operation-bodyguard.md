I'm not a big fan of war stories (other than Full Metal Jacket, because awesome) but I've become quite a big fan of some of the deception techniques that are used in warfare. Some of the scope and breadth of deception that happens during war can't really be compared with anything in modern day life.

Some innovations that occured starting from WW1 are truly fascinating. Take [Dazzle Camouflage][2] for one. However, I'm not here to tell you about razzle dazzle today. I'm here to enlighten you to Operation Bodyguard.

Operation Bodyguard is often considered one of the largest deception plans to date, and was a major part of WW2 and tipping the war in the Allies favour. 

It culminated in the tactical surprise at the Normandy landings, one of the most famous bits of WW2 and probably the bit that's been ripped off the most in every film and game to do with war ever.

Operation Bodyguard was really a plan built on several smaller plans. Some of the tactics used included misdirecting Nazi reinforcements by sending small amounts of Allied troops to one location to make the Nazis think they were attacking one way, but sending the rest of the Allied troops the other way for the "real" attack.

Operation Fortitude really takes the biscuit though: it was basically a plan to make Allied forces look bigger and better than they actually were.  Tactics included everything from creating fictional field armies, faked operations, and false "leaked" information about Allied plans.

The Allies even tried to convince the Nazis that they were building ties with new countries in preperation for an invasion.

I've only covered a few of the tactics here, [so I urge you to go read the rest on Wikipedia][1].
