What if I was to say that thereâ€™s a chord progression that a lot of popular music uses over and over?

What if I was to tell you that it's not just used in mainstream popular music, but also across rock music and other genres?

What if I told you that everyone from The Offspring through to Busted, from The Police to Taylor Swift have used it?

[Would you believe me][1]?

Even Axis of Awesome [made a song about it][2].
